This project was the final project for the last database course in Dawson College. The goal was to create, from scratch, a database for an internet provider and develop several applications to interact with the database using Java. This project was done in groups of three. I contributed heavily into the design of the database and was completely in charge of the application that let sales employee interact with the database. The project made us practice many important database concept such as database planification using UML charts, concrete creation of databases, implementation of important design principles, normalization of data, information querying, creation of procedures, interaction with the database using different languages such as Java and much more.
